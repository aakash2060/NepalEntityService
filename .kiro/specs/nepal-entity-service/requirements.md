# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nepal Entity Service is a comprehensive Python package designed to manage Nepali public entities (persons, organizations, and locations). The system serves as the foundation for the Nepal Public Accountability Portal, providing structured data management, versioning, and relationship tracking for entities in Nepal's political and administrative landscape.

The entity service hosts a public API that allows anyone to get the entity, relationship, and other information from the system. Besides, the entity will leverage web scraping capabilities assisted with GenAI/LLM to ensure data completeness and accuracy.

## Glossary

- **Entity**: A public person, organization, location in Nepal's political/administrative system
- **Entity_Database**: A database storing entity/relationship/other information with versioning support. Currently we provide a file system-based adapter at `nes-db/v2`
- **Nepal_Entity_Service** and **NES**: Core service that loads the entity database and exposes retrieval endpoints. The APIs will be read-only
- **NES API**: FastAPI web service providing entity retrieval endpoints
- **Publication_Service**: Central orchestration layer managing entity lifecycle, relationships, and versioning using core Pydantic models
- **Search_Service**: Read-optimized service providing entity and relationship search with filtering and pagination
- **Migration_Service**: Service orchestrating database updates through versioned migration scripts with Git-based tracking
- **Scraping_Service**: Standalone service for extracting and normalizing data from external sources using GenAI/LLM

- **Accountability_Portal**: Public-facing web platform for transparency and accountability
- **Entity_Type**: Classification of entities (person, organization, location, etc.)
- **Entity_SubType**: Specific classification within entity types (political_party, government_body, etc.)
- **Version_System**: Audit trail system tracking changes to entities and relationships over time using the Version model
- **Relationship_System**: System managing connections between entities using the Relationship model
- **Scraping_Tools**: ML-powered tools for building entity databases from external sources, using various providers including AWS, Google Cloud/Vertex AI, and OpenAI
